Server
======

The server component used to run on a Google app engine server and was originally implemented in Python, but as of 02/2016,
the Python version has been deprecated and replaced with a reimplementation in Go, which can be found at
https://github.com/jcharra/go-entrisserver

The deprecated Python server code remains in the "server" subdirectory.
