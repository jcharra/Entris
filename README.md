Components
==========

Entris has a server component that's prepared to run on a Google app engine server. Currently there is one 
running at http://entrisserver.appspot.com/ that you can connect to when running the client. The server code can be 
found in the "server" subdirectory. It's extremely simple and has never been pushed to its limits, it probably doesn't 
scale too well.

The client component resides in the "client" subdirectory.
